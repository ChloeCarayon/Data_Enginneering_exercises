Create a dockerized web application using nodejs for the backend, 
and a MySQL server as the database. You should use docker compose for the application building.  

- Docker run 
``` docker-compose up```

- Docker stop and clean
``` docker-compose down ```
```docker image rm -f nodejs_project_web ```
